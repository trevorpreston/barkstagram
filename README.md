# iKe$ha - Your iTunes for Ke$ha

Ke$ha, musical legend and future nobel laureate, wants to create a website to promote everything Ke$ha.  It has to be $wanky, a little trashy and inspire its users to "wake up feeling like PDiddy".

## Goals

This assignment will use the super friendly iTunes API and ask you to perform various queries.  You will then take the data returned from those queries and apply it to the front end using your excellent DOM skills.  

You have some starter html, css and JS files but they are basically empty.  You are set up with JQuery.

## Specs:

Ke$ha's website should be one page.  That page should be broken into 3 sections.  The sections are:

1. The first section should render an *unordered list* of all of her albums.  Give this section a header that says "Ke$ha's Albums!".
2. The second section should render images of her albums *that are not explicit* (gotta protect the children).  Albums that are explicit should not be rendered.  Give this section a header that says "Ke$ha's Kid Friendly Jams".
3. The third section should return her 5 most recent tracks.  Give this section a header that says "Ke$ha's Latest Hits".
4. Feel sad about how long it's been since Ke$ha's latest release.
